# Consid Programming Contest

Consid had a programming contest, and I won it. This was my submission. Everything relevant is stored in this repo (including a copy of the html article announcing me as the winner).

The main reason I didn't make this public until now is because I didn't actually expect to win. The code is ridiculusly untested and I expect it to break apart if tried on any other input than what was provided in the contest. However, at this point a few years after the contest I think it hardly matters any more. So here it is.
